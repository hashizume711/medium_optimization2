# Data
culture_result sheet : 
This sheet describes the relationship between culture medium composition and cell proliferation. Each compound name represents the addition volume (Î¼L) of the compound stock required to prepare 1 mL of the culture medium. The columns commercial_eRDF and lab_made_eRDF contain the cell concentrations (cells/mL) when commercial and lab-made eRDF were used in the same culture round. The cell_concentration column represents the achieved cell concentration (cells/mL) for each culture medium. The fold_change column indicates the cell_concentration relative to lab_made_eRDF.

cocktail information : 
This sheet includes information on cocktails. The Cocktail column indicates the classification of the cocktail, while the addition column represents the addition volume of the compound stock required to prepare 1 mL of commercial eRDF medium.

compound stock sheet : 
This sheet includes the concentrations of the compound stocks used for culture medium preparation.
